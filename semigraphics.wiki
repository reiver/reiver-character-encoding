§ semigraphics

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Semigraphics** are graphics created using [[character‐glyphs]] from a [[character‐set]] that has special characters for that purpose.

Many of the different types of historic semigraphics have been added to [[unicode]].
Some examples of these include:

• unicode block‐elements,
• unicode box‐drawing‐characters, and
• unicode geometric‐shapes.

Related to semigraphics are:

• [[ansi‐art]],
• [[ansimations]],
• [[ascii‐art]],
• [[mouse‐text]].
