§ ansimation

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

An **ansimation** is an animation created using characters from some type of [[character-set]] (which was usually [[cp437]]) and ANSI‐escape‐codes.

The ANSI‐escape‐codes are typically used for:

• moving the text cursor,
• clearing all or some part of the line,
• clearing all or some part of the screen,
• setting the background color of a character,
• setting the foreground color of a character.

**Ansimations** are designed to run on [[computer-terminal]]s or [[computer-terminal-emulator]]s that support ANSI‐escape‐codes.

An ansimation animation's frame-rate depends on the inherent baud-rates of the computer-terminal.
The faster the baud-rate, the faster the frame-rate of the ansimation animation.
The slower the baud-rate, the slower the frame-rate of the ansimation animation.
