§ CP437

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The **CP437** [[character-set]] is a 256-bit character-set that was common with the IBM PC and the IBM PC clones.

Other names for CP437 include:

• csPC8CodePage437,
• code-page-437,
• dos-latin-us,
• oem-437,
• oem-us, and
• pc-8.

All CP437 characters have equivalents in the [[unicode]] character-set; although that numerical representations of the characters are different with many of them.

§§ Art

A lot of the vintage [[ansi-art]], including [[ansimation]]s, used the **cp437** character-set.

A lot of the (so called) [[ascii-art]] also actually used the **cp437** character-set (rather than the [[ascii]] character-set.)
