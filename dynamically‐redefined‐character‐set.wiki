§ Dynamically Redefined Character Set

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The [[computer-terminal]] **dynamically-redefined-character-set** (**DRCS**) is a technology that can be used to upload new [[character-glyph]]s to a computer-terminal at a range of character‐code‐points so that an application can use them for their own custom character-glyphs for their own custom characters.

With the **dynamically-redefined-character-set** (**DRCS**) technology, new character-glyphs are uploaded to the computer-terminal using the [[sixel]] bitmap graphics data-format.

The computer-terminal **dynamically‐redefined‐character‐set** (**DRCS**) technology is similar in idea of a [[unicode/private‐use‐area]].

The custom character fonts uploaded into a computer-terminal that has **dynamically-redefined-character-set** (**DRCS**) technology is called a **soft-character-set**.

Some computer-terminals that supported the **dynamically-redefined-character-set** (**DRCS**) technology include:

• [[vt220]]
• [[vt240]]
• [[vt241]]
• [[vt320]]
• [[vt420]]
